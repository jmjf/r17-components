# Custom hooks for state

-  `useEffect()` for life cycle events
-  Aim for declarative style
   -  Instead of directly updating the UI, set state that controls UI behavior

## Async loading

-  Currently, `SpeakersList` uses an array and we search through it
-  Real world, it will be a database and things will be differently
-  Simulate delayed load by adding a delay

-  Add `useEffect()` in `SpeakersList` to set state (`useState([] as ISpeaker[])` and `setSpeakers(data)` in the `useEffect()` instead)
-  Add a `delay()` function and call it in `useEffect()`
   -  `useEffect()` isn't async, so wrap the code in an async function and call that function

```TypeScript
	useEffect(() => {
		const delayedAction = async () => {
			await delay(2000);
			setSpeakers(data);
		};
		delayedAction();
	});
```

Now UI draws, then speakers appear ~2 seconds later.

But there's a problem. `useEffect()` is being called every time the `SpeakerList` renders. Click on a favorite icon. Watch it change, then change back 2 seconds later when `useEffect()` sets the state back to the original value again.

`useEffect()` takes an array (2nd parameter) that tells it what must change to qualify for running the effect. You can [skip effects](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects) that don't meet the conditions. Pass an empty array to never run after first run. (Now we don't lose favorite changes on the UI.)

### Loading indicator

What's a delay without a loading indicator? And what about errors (if the real world database dies)? So, we need to track:

-  Loading status
-  Error status (and message)

While loading, show a loading message.
If it errors, show an error message (`catch`).
Can `throw` an error on purpose to see the error behavior.

### Fallback renderer

A fallback renderer renders placeholder elements while your data is loading.

-  `npm install react-placeholder` and import it.
   -  https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-placeholder
-  Wrap the contents of the `container` `<div>` in `<ReactPlaceHolder>`
   -  Takes several attributes, but the important one is `ready` which defines the condition when the data is ready

But now I'm getting an error in the browser about an invalid hook call. Maybe because `react-placeholder` hasn't been updated for a year. Let's try `react-content-loader` which is more recent. I'm going to use one of the default loaders and worry about a custom loader later.

Okay, it's working in a way comparable to what he gets, so I'll fiddle with it later. Maybe switch to a simple spinner type loading indicator, given what I'm seeing.

## A custom hook for speaker data state

Components can get complex. Refactor state and life cycle management out of the component with a custom hook.

-  Hooks can contain other hooks
-  Custom hook = function that returns objects/variables

-  What data do we need to return?
   -  isLoadError
   -  loadErrorMessage
   -  isLoading
   -  speakers
   -  onFavoriteToggle()
-  He names the hook `useRequestSpeakers`, maybe looking ahead at a possible future load from an async source.

-  Create `src/hooks/useRequestSpeakers.ts`
-  Create hook function to accept `delayMs` and move code to it
-  Define interface for hook to return (five attributes above)
-  In the component, destructure the function result to get the values the component needs

**COMMIT: 3.0.2 - REFACTOR: move state and effect to a custom hook**

### Use status instead of booleans

When you have mutually exclusive boolean status flags, you create a possibility that you'll change one and not the other. The result could cause inconsistent behavior. So prefer proper status values i

How I approached it

-  In `useRequestSpeakers`, replace booleans `isLoading` and `isLoadError` with `componentStatus`
-  Define `type ComponentStatusType = 'LOADING' | 'LOADERROR' | 'READY';`
-  Initialize `componentStatus` to `'LOADING' as ComponentStatusType`
-  Set `componentStatus` appropriately in `useRequestSpeakers`
-  Change return for `useRequestSpeakers` (replace booleans with `componentStatus`)
-  In `SpeakersList`, change destructure to get `componentStatus`
-  `switch (componentStatus)` and return JSX for each state
-  `default:` returns a `<div>` reporting an unknown status
   -  `ComponentStatusType` should make it hard to return an unknown value, but covering the case is easy

What the instructor did differently

-  Differently named, but equivalent, status values as members of an object (because JS doesn't have types)
-  `export`s his object (not needed because TS type carries over automatically)
-  Doesn't use `switch`, just replaces conditions with comparisons to value instead of true

**COMMIT: 3.0.3 - REFACTOR: use a status value instead of booleans to avoid inconsistent status**

### Making `useRequestSpeakers()` reusable

The goal is to make the code reusable for any data with an id.

-  Rename hook to `useRequestDelay`
-  Pass initial data (in the real world, would be an adapter that gets the data or an adapter method that gets the data)
-  Return `data` instead of `speakers`
-  Make `onFavoriteToggle()` a more general update

Hmm. I'm not sure how far I'll go down the route because it may create type issues.

-  If I declare an interface with just an id and then extend it where it's used, I think I can make it work
-  I'll put the new code in a new file for now
-  Also, my hook will take a function that returns `IRequestData[]`, simulating a real world data adapter
   -  And I'm putting `getSpeakerData()` in `SpeakerData.ts`, which is more realistic than putting it with the component
-  Because `onFavoriteToggle()` changed, among other things, this change seems to ripple through the whole component hierarchy
   -  Not sure that's right, let's see what happens
   -  Ah, he's just going to change how `onFavoriteToggle()` works
-  Generics to the rescue
   -  If I:
      -  Declare `function useRequestDelay<T extends IRequestData>(getData() => T[], ... ): IUseRequestData<T>`
      -  Replace `IRequestData` with `T` in `IUseRequestData`
   -  Then I can destructure `useRequestDelay<ISpeaker>(getSpeakerData, 2000)` easily with no extra casting
-  In `SpeakerCard` destructure with `id: speakerId` to rename to fix the component.

This is looking less unreasonable than I thought. The only trick is, everything that uses the reusbale hook needs to ensure it has a type that `extends IRequestData`, which requires an `id`. This violates some naming patterns I prefer (`speakerId` vs `id`), but it's tolerable for now. I could probably work around it by using `id` and `speakerId` with the same values. (Memory is cheap.)

-  Had to remove the `<ContentLoader />` and replace it with a simple `<div>` because it was causing errors in the console. (It worked, but I don't want console errors.)
-  Had an issue with the Favorite icon not toggling. The update action is in a wrapper function so it can delay. I forgot to call it. Now everything works with the delays as expected.
-  Also made the update function change the status to LOADING before it starts the delay and READY after it updates anticipating I might add a spinner in the future. (Ah. I see that's coming later this module and probably using a different technique)
-  Removed `useRequestSpeakers.ts` now that this is working

**COMMIT: 3.0.4 - REFACTOR: rebuild hook for delayed data loads to be generic and reusable**

## Use a completion callback to control an updating indicator

We're passing the function to execute on the Favorite click through several levels of the component hierarchy. The update function runs (and changes data) on the upper level of the component, which ripples down.

We want to have a "change in progress" indicator next to Favorite when it's updating (improvement over my current solution). So, we can pass a callback that tells `SpeakerFavorite` to hide the icon when the update is done.

-  I wonder if it's possible to have a status that would affect only the updated component. Probably unwise because it would be putting bottom level component specificity into the top level of the component tree. (Would need to identify which component is waiting for the update so only that component is affected. I can see that getting ugly and causing other issues if more than one is updating.)
-  So, I'm guessing that means the callback will set some kind of state on the descendant to tell it to stop showing the loading spinner.

Rule of thumb: Put the callback execution as close to the place that changes the state as possible, which usually means adjacent to it.

-  Pass a callback to the `useRequestDelay` hook's `saveData()`. Default it to do nothing.
   -  Other option is to not default, requiring a value, but I think it's better to say that no cb passed means you don't care than to litter the code with "I don't care" do nothing functions or references to one.
-  So, I think that means `SpeakerFavorite` needs to pass a callback and needs state that controls the spinner. When click calls `saveData()` aka `onFavoriteToggle()`, it sets state to spinner on. The callback sets state to spinner off.
   -  I've set up the code. It feels a little clunky, but it seems to mostly work.
   -  Part of me thinks if I moved the favorite updating state to the top level it would feel better, but I expect that wouldn't work because it doesn't discriminate at the individual `SpeakerCard` level.
   -  Maybe I could put the state on the `SpeakerCard` and pass it to the callback.
   -  Issue I'm seeing: Favorite toggles off, then back on.
      -  Some instrumentation shows the `getData()` effect is running after the `saveData()`.
      -  Problem is the dependency array. I'd removed it early because the effect depends on `delayMs` and `getData()`and the linter was warning. I'll just add them to the array so the linter will be happy.

Except for using a spinner, it looks like it's working. Let's see what the instructor does.

-  Same basic thing, but minus TypeScript and some of the smaller details I chose to build
   -  Doesn't provide a default callback
   -  His first version isn't using state, just `console.log()`
   -  Defined callback alone and used an anonymous function in the `onClick={}` (vs. I wrote a click handler function that does everything and passed that function, which I think makes intent more explicit)
   -  Doesn't do anything visually to indicating updating

Now let's replace the `updating` string with a spinner.

-  He adds state to toggle spinner on and off (default off), which I did above
   -  Calls it `inTransition`, but I think `isUpdating` is more explicit about intent
-  Sets state to true (spinner on) in the click handler, which I did above
-  Sets state to false (spinner off) in the callback, which I did above
-  Adds a conditional span that displays a spinner (Font Awesome based) based on state
   -  Replaced my string with his span
   -  He used `fa-circle-notch`, but I like `fa-sync` better, so using it.
   -  He returns `null` for the false state, where I return an empty span; switching to `null`

I tested clicking two favorite icons at once and they spin independently as expected.

**COMMIT: 3.0.5 - FEAT: add a spinner while the favorite toggle is running so the user knows the app is doing something**

## Good practices notes

-  Choose named functions vs. nameless lambdas wisely
   -  Named functions for callbacks are often clearer
-  `async/await` syntax is usually easier to reason about than chained Promises (`.then/.catch/.finally`)
-  Prefer status values instead of boolean status flags
-  Return `null` for empty elements insted of an empty element
