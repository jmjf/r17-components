# Using context with a REST API

-  Add CRUD capabilities to the application so we can change data
-  Build a local REST server with NextJS API routes
-  `SpeakerContext` will provide the CRUD operations

For reference, this diagram shows the relationship between components involved in this module. The `SpeakerContext` will hold all the data for this hierarchy so we can stop passing props.

## What will `SpeakerContext` do?

-  Hold data for a single speaker (each `SpeakerCard` will have its own context)
-  Allow updating `FavoriteFlag` on `FavoriteToggle` click
   -  Will replace `onFavoriteToggle` in `SpeakersList`

## Getting started

My natural inclination is to start by building the base context and adding functions to it as I go, but he's starting with `SpeakersList`, so let's see where that leads. He says the goal is to put the context (provider) as far down the tree as practical, which I'm guessing means `SpeakerCard`.

`SpeakerCard`s are rendered from `SpeakersList` with a map over a filtered list of speakers. Each `SpeakerCard` receives an `onFavoriteToggle()` that gets passed down to `FavoriteToggle`. We'll get that from the context, so won't need it. `SpeakersList` will pass `SpeakerCard` a speaker's data and an update function. (I'm not sure where the update function is coming from in `SpeakersList` yet, but we'll see.)

He moves to creating the context.

-  I'd try to create the state first, but let's see
-  Hmm. He isn't creating a state (custom hook) for this context; that messes up my type strategy
   -  So, I'll declare a state interface in the context and merge it with the `PropsWithChildren` React type and all seems happy now

So, let's use this in the `SpeakerCard`

-  Wrap the `SpeakerCard` elements in the context provider and pass the values from props
-  Remove props from children where supplied by the context
-  I've done that on my own, except I'm not sure where he's going with the update function
   -  If he builds the update to take a whole speaker, then `FavoriteToggle` just calls `updateSpeaker({ ...speaker, favoriteFlag: !speaker.favoriteFlag})`; I'm guessing our done callback will still be in play, so I''ll need to change `ISpeakerContextState`, which currently doesn't take a callback
   -  Let's see how he does it and what I like/don't like about his strategy
   -  Oh, just noticed I need to move context to `Sessions` or `Session`
      -  `Sessions` filters the sessions to show, so I'm wondering if he'll continue to pass props to `Session` or if he'll have a trick in `Session` that will let him filter there
-  Adjustments
   -  Yes, he passes the callback, so add to the type for `updateSpeaker` in `ISpeakerContextState`
   -  Yes, call to `updateSpeaker` was as I expected except for callback
   -  Yes, he's using the context in `Sessions`, not `Session`

Many things touched, but let's see how the app works. I expect issues because we don't have `updateSpeaker` yet.

-  Looks like display works, but toggling favorite throws an error, as expected

I'm going to commit what I have so the changes for this context are recorded.

**COMMIT: 4.5.1 - REFACTOR: create and use SpeakerContext instead of prop drilling speaker data down the tree**

## Add create and delete to `useRequestDelay`

Hmm. Listening to him talk, I'm wondering if I missed him using this hook in `SpeakerContext` setup. Or maybe he's going there next.

Looking at his GH repo, I see what I missed. I forgot we have a generic state/hook for data that, in his implementation has `updateRecord`, which I called `saveData`. So, what I thought was `updateSpeakers` is `saveData`. So, let's get that working, which should fix the favorite toggle issue.

-  Type `updateSpeaker` correctly (to accept callback) in `SpeakersList` properties
-  In `SpeakersList` reference to `SpeakerCard`, pass `updateSpeaker={saveData}`
-  That fixes the favorite toggle issue
-  I could change all references to `updateSpeaker` to `saveData`, but I think I'll leave the prop rename for explicitness
-  I will change `saveData` to `updateData` in the hook so verbs are consistent

**COMMIT: 4.5.2 - FIX: make favorite toggle work; missed what the instructor was doing with the update function**
