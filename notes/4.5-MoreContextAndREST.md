# Using context with a REST API

-  Add CRUD capabilities to the application so we can change data
-  Build a local REST server with NextJS API routes
-  `SpeakerContext` will provide the CRUD operations

For reference, this diagram shows the relationship between components involved in this module. The `SpeakerContext` will hold all the data for this hierarchy so we can stop passing props.

![diagram showing relationship between Speaker Card and its descendant components Speaker Image, Speaker Info, which has descendant Favorite Toggle, and Sessions, which has descendant Session](diagrams/SpeakerCardComponentHierarchy.drawio.png 'SpeakerCard component hierarchy')

## What will `SpeakerContext` do?

-  Hold data for a single speaker (each `SpeakerCard` will have its own context)
-  Allow updating `FavoriteFlag` on `FavoriteToggle` click
   -  Will replace `onFavoriteToggle` in `SpeakersList`

## Getting started

My natural inclination is to start by building the base context and adding functions to it as I go, but he's starting with `SpeakersList`, so let's see where that leads. He says the goal is to put the context (provider) as far down the tree as practical, which I'm guessing means `SpeakerCard`.

`SpeakerCard`s are rendered from `SpeakersList` with a map over a filtered list of speakers. Each `SpeakerCard` receives an `onFavoriteToggle()` that gets passed down to `FavoriteToggle`. We'll get that from the context, so won't need it. `SpeakersList` will pass `SpeakerCard` a speaker's data and an update function. (I'm not sure where the update function is coming from in `SpeakersList` yet, but we'll see.)

He moves to creating the context.

-  I'd try to create the state first, but let's see
-  Hmm. He isn't creating a state (custom hook) for this context; that messes up my type strategy
   -  So, I'll declare a state interface in the context and merge it with the `PropsWithChildren` React type and all seems happy now

So, let's use this in the `SpeakerCard`

-  Wrap the `SpeakerCard` elements in the context provider and pass the values from props
-  Remove props from children where supplied by the context
-  I've done that on my own, except I'm not sure where he's going with the update function
   -  If he builds the update to take a whole speaker, then `FavoriteToggle` just calls `updateSpeaker({ ...speaker, favoriteFlag: !speaker.favoriteFlag})`; I'm guessing our done callback will still be in play, so I''ll need to change `ISpeakerContextState`, which currently doesn't take a callback
   -  Let's see how he does it and what I like/don't like about his strategy
   -  Oh, just noticed I need to move context to `Sessions` or `Session`
      -  `Sessions` filters the sessions to show, so I'm wondering if he'll continue to pass props to `Session` or if he'll have a trick in `Session` that will let him filter there
-  Adjustments
   -  Yes, he passes the callback, so add to the type for `updateSpeaker` in `ISpeakerContextState`
   -  Yes, call to `updateSpeaker` was as I expected except for callback
   -  Yes, he's using the context in `Sessions`, not `Session`

Many things touched, but let's see how the app works. I expect issues because we don't have `updateSpeaker` yet.

-  Looks like display works, but toggling favorite throws an error, as expected

I'm going to commit what I have so the changes for this context are recorded.

**COMMIT: 4.5.1 - REFACTOR: create and use SpeakerContext instead of prop drilling speaker data down the tree**

## Add create and delete to `useRequestDelay`

Hmm. Listening to him talk, I'm wondering if I missed him using this hook in `SpeakerContext` setup. Or maybe he's going there next.

Looking at his GH repo, I see what I missed. I forgot we have a generic state/hook for data that, in his implementation has `updateRecord`, which I called `saveData`. So, what I thought was `updateSpeakers` is `saveData`. So, let's get that working, which should fix the favorite toggle issue.

-  Type `updateSpeaker` correctly (to accept callback) in `SpeakersList` properties
-  In `SpeakersList` reference to `SpeakerCard`, pass `updateSpeaker={saveData}`
-  That fixes the favorite toggle issue
-  I could change all references to `updateSpeaker` to `saveData`, but I think I'll leave the prop rename for explicitness
-  I will change `saveData` to `updateData` in the hook so verbs are consistent

**COMMIT: 4.5.2 - FIX: make favorite toggle work; missed what the instructor was doing with the update function**

Okay, back to the video.

-  Copy/paste `updateData` and rename `insertData`
   -  I think the easy solution to just add the new record to the array; maybe check for duplicate first
   -  He isn't checking for duplicates, so I'll skip for now
   -  I'm also thinking we need a reliable way to generate ids, but assume that will come in the future; if not, might make a good extra exercise later
-  Copy `insertData` to `deleteData`
   -  I'm thinking `Array.filter()` to exclude the deleted item
   -  Yep, that's what he does
-  Return the functions in the result, so add them to the interface; plus some name adjustments and adding a `DMLFunctionType` to make writing/maintaining the interface easier in the future
-  Add them to the destructure from `useRequestDelay()` in `SpeakersList` and pass to `SpeakerCard` and pass and add to the `SpeakerContextProvider`

Putting them in the context makes them available to all children of `SpeakerCard`

**COMMIT: 4.5.3 - FEAT: add insert and delete capability to SpeakerContext and useRequestDelay**

## We need a UI for these new capabilities

### Add speaker

New component `AddSpeaker` -> (+) symbol to add a speaker at the top of the speaker list
Needs current filtered year (he wants to automatically add a session for the year so the new speaker will show up)
Also needs insert function

I built the basic component with a simmple `<div>` to prove it worked, now he's writing a "simple" 20-odd line `<a>` for it.

-  I think I'd put the click handler in a separate function; leaving inline makes it harder to see the page layout and seems like a mix of concerns
-  The function needs a couple of parameters and doesn't really need the event, so I wrote a simple inline handler to `preventDefault()` and call the prompt and add function

Initial testing seems to have an issue. Adding a speaker doesn't update the speaker list

-  A few `console.log()`s later and I see I have the wrong value for `eventYear`; changing it fixes the problem
-  While testing this, I learned that updating state doesn't seem to change the value in the function immediately

### Delete speaker

Each `SpeakerCard` will have a delete button beneat the sessions list

-  Does this button delete the sessions for the year only? The whole speaker and all sessions for all years?
-  Add this to the `SpeakerCard`? As a separate element below `SpeakerCard` in the `map()` in `SpeakerList`?
   -  I think not part of the `SpeakerCard` because add/delete seem like capabilities against the list; can make each delete specific to the speaker
-  Prompt (are you sure)? Just delete?
   -  I'm inclined to prompt.

So, we'll have a similar `DeleteSpeaker` component that will take and call the delete function; shouldn't need year unless we're deleting only sessions for the current year

-  The delete function wants the whole speaker, so need to pass the speaker and delete function to it
-  The handler is much shorter, so I inlined it; I could be convinced to move it out again without much effort
-  Putting the delete component in `SpeakerList` places it beside, not below, so let's move into `SpeakerCard` instead
   -  Better, but needs more top margin, let's see how he codes the JSX (applied some extra wrapping he used)
   -  Ah, because this is in `SpeakerCard`, which has the `SpeakerContext` available, use context in the delete component
-  I prompted and required a YES input, he's using confirm (cancel/OK); will switch

And it seems to work.

### Other

The insert icon isn't centered well. Really needs line-height 30px instead of the 22px he has, but I'm leaving it for now.

**COMMIT: 4.5.4 - FEAT: add controls and simple UI to add and delete speakers from the list**

## REST with NextJS

We keep data in memory with artifical delays. Let's build some endpoints with NextJS to act more like a real data source might.

-  GET, PUT, POST, DELETE against /api/speakers
-  https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/dynamic-api-routes

Hmm. Maybe I missed it, but he seems to be using an object with constants for request status. In TS, I've also used enums or a strategy of defining a type by

-  `export const SomethingTypeValues`, which is an object with attribtues named for the values, which I can use to get values
-  `export type SomethingType = typeof SomethingTypeValues[keyof typeof SomethingTypeValues];` to get a type
-  `export const validSomethingTypes = Object.values(SomethingTypeValues);`, which I can use to validate raw values against allowed values (example, from an HTTP request object or database read)
-  Not going to do that here, but noting it for reference in case I come back to make this more robust--if some of the other courses in this track don't get me there or I don't pick a different problem for a real world learning project

### NestJS docs notes

-  For API route `api/posts/abc`, write code in `pages/api/posts/[pid].ts` (or `.js`)
-  `export default function handler (req, res) {}`
-  Call `res.end(<return value>)` to respond
-  In this example, `req.query` includes an attribute `pid` you can destructure and use
-  `req` includes `method` so you can `switch (method)` to handle different HTTP verbs
-  The NextJS examples suggest there's more complexity here, so I'll see where he's going with this.

So, I think we're going to end up writing a base route (no suffix or `index.js`) for GET and a `users/[id]` route that handles other methods.

### Instructor's explanation

-  NextJS runs a web server to host your application (like most frameworks)
-  Uses SSR to reduce load and FOUT-like behavior

### Building it

-  `pages/api/speakers/index.ts`
-  For GET, the handler basically needs to `res.status(200).send(JSON.stringify(getSpeakerData()))`, where `getSpeakerData()` is from `SpeakerData.ts`
-  For data changing actions, we need to update the data. Use `path`, `fs` and `promisify` -- `const readfile = promisify(fs.readFile)`
-  He's using a JSON file for his data
   -  Rather than a lot of typing or pulling from his GH repo, make the `speakers` GET return a formatted JSON and copy/paste into the file
-  Some file reading and parsing later (and a few small improvments), it's working.

**COMMIT: 4.5.5 - FEAT: add NestJS API route for GET /api/speakers route; read data from JSON file instead of memory so we can persist changes in the future**

### PUT, POST, DELETE

Let's make a copy of `db.json` so it's easy to recover.

A route file with path `pages/api/speakers/[id].ts` receives calls for a path with an id parameter and passes it in the request.

-  We can start with a copy of `index.js` for the route
-  Need a promisified `writeFile`

So, I'm guessing I need to

-  Update the list of speakers
-  Overwrite the file
-  Return 200 (do we need to return the body?) or error

For PUT, `map()` to update the array; for POST, spread to add to the array; for DELETE, `filter()` to remove from the array

He puts each action in a separate (async) method. I'm not sure that's really necessary, but I'll see where this goes.

-  Ah, he's creating a speaker id, so the methods have some differences; and they're enough to warrant separating this logic, though part of me really hates copying all the read and update code
-  Wait, he isn't passing `res`, `req`, or anything else; oh, he made them functions inside `handler()` rather than external
-  Okay, let's split this mess
-  I note he's using `==` instead of `===`, especially with id comparisons because the id in the file is a string, but he's `parseInt()`ed it
   -  Instead, in the one place types need to convert (POST finding the max id to assign a new one), I'm converting the result to a string so I can use `===`; he has to `parseInt()` in the `reduce()` anyway, so it's easy `toString()` the final result.

Looking at the code, I'm going to refactor

-  Pull the `try/catch` into `handler()`
-  Move the `switch` into the `try`'s `else` clause
-  Pass `speakers` (data from file, which is inside the `try` block) to each method
-  Reduce the method functions to what was in each function's `try` `else` block

I could go further and have each method function return `{statusCode: number, responseBody: string, newSpeakers: ISpeaker[]}`, which would let me avoid the duplicate `writeFile()` and mostly duplicate response handling, but I'm leaving it for now. This API is not production grade in a number of ways, including lacking some error handling and data quality checks that it should be enforcing.

Actually, it isn't hard, so I'm going to do it.

-  Declare type for result from method handlers
-  Declare method handlers to return it
-  Assign a `let` variable the method handler result in the `switch`
-  Return correct responses for each method handler
-  Move the duplicate code to `handler()`
-  Use values from the method handler result

That looks much better, IMO. I could destructure the method result, but this is good for now.

**COMMIT: 4.5.6 - FEAT: add POST, PUT, DELETE handling to the NestJS API route**
