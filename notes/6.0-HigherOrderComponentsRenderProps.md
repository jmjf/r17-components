# Higher order components (HOCs) and render props

-  Method used to pass information between components before Context
-  Common in third party libraries, especially auth/auth
-  Common when using Redux
-  Independent components used as props for consuming components
-  Export what's returned from the HOC call instead of the component

```jsx
const Speakers = ({ speakers }) => {
	return <div>{speakers}...</div>;
};

export default withData()(Speakers);
```

-  Render props are embedded in component and returned with the component

```jsx
const Speakers = () => {
	return (
		<MyRP>
			{({ speakers }) => {
				return <div>{speakers}...</div>;
			}}
		</MyRP>
	);
};

export default Speakers;
```

Help separate "get the data" from "render the data".

## HOCs

Create a new component that has both data and UI and then separate data from UI

-  In `pages/speakers.tsx`, `Speakers` with an array of three speakers (image source and name only) and returning image tags (`speakers.map()`)

```tsx
const Speakers = () => {
	const speakers = [
		{ imageSrc: 'speaker-1124', name: 'Douglas Crockford' },
		{ imageSrc: 'speaker-1530', name: 'Tamara Baker' },
		{ imageSrc: 'speaker-10803', name: 'Eugene Chuvyrov' },
	];

	return (
		<div>
			{speakers.map(({ imageSrc, name }) => {
				return <img src={`images/${imageSrc}`} alt={name} key={imageSrc}></img>;
			})}
		</div>
	);
};
```

HOC -> function that takes a component and returns a new component

```tsx
const EnhancedSpeaker = withData(Speakers);
```

Now we need `withData()`, which doesn't do much for now

-  Good info on best TS syntax for this is hard to come by because it varies depending on factors

```tsx
function withData(ComponentToWrap: ComponentType) {
	const WrappedComponent = (props: any) => {
		return <ComponentToWrap {...props} />;
	};
	return WrappedComponent;
}
```

Looks like the video is chopped up wrong here.

When I run with those parts in place and `export default EnhancedSpeaker` and navigate to `localhost:3000/speakers`, I get broken images, but alt texts as expected. Add `.jpg` on the end of the `<img src="" />` source and the images load.

Now he moves the data out of `Speakers` into `withData` and passes the speaker array to `Speakers` as a prop. This gives TypeScript fits, possibly because I'm not sure what React types I should be using. But with some `any`ing, I'm able to get it to work for demo purposes.

The key point is, we've moved the data (state, etc.) out of the `Speakers` component. `withData()` is reusable with other components. So

-  Move `withData()` to a separate file and import.
-  I moved the interface that defines the speaker data structure with it and named it `IHOCSpeaker`
-  In `pages/speakers.tsx`, `export default withData(Speakers)`

Redux uses similar syntax -- `export default connect()(TheComponent)`

So, imagine we want `withData()` to show two speakers only.

```ts
// in speakers.tsx
export default withData(2)(Speakers);

// in withData.tsx
function withData(maxToShow: number) {
   return function (ComponentToWrap: any) {
      ...
      const WrappedComponent = (props: any) => {
			const slicedSpeakers = speakers.slice(0, maxToShow);
			return <ComponentToWrap {...props} speakers={slicedSpeakers} />;
		};
      ...
   }
}

```

The example is simplistic. Understand the concept of what's going on here, which is like a higher order function in functional programming.

**COMMIT: 6.0.1 - FEAT: add a speakers page that demonstrates how a higher order component works**

## Render props

Render prop is a function that returns a React component/element. The component calls the function to render content instead of rendering itself.

-  I wonder if might also be a way to inject different child components based on business logic

-  Rename `pages/speakers.tsx` to `pages/speakersHoc.tsx` to keep it separate
-  Create `pages/speakersRP.tsx` for the render prop version
-  Start with same base code as before (data in the component)
-  Check that it works
-  Wrap the UI part in `<SpeakersRenderProps>` and make it an anonymous function
-  Add `SpeakersRenderProps` function for the new component
   -  Returns `props.children()` because `children` is a function the way we've written it
   -  This isn't playing well with types; `PropsWithChildren` doesn't expect a function
   -  Looks like everyone is declaring their own props type to get around this issue

So, `SpeakersRenderProps` is accepting a prop that is a function that returns a `ReactElement` (or other renderable React type?). And now we can move the data into `SpeakersRenderProps` and pass it to the `children()` function.

-  Move `SpeakersRenderProps` and all the interfaces needed to declare it to a separate file (reusable)
-  Import in `speakersRP.tsx`

Again, the example is over simplified to illustrate the idea, so get the basic concept of a component that gets a `children` prop that's a function and then calls that, possibly with paramenters.

Hopefully, we have some more practical examples coming up.

**COMMIT: 6.0.2 - FEAT: add a speakersRP page that uses render props to illustrate the concept**

## Using HOCs with context

HOCs hide details of HOC's internals from the consumer, but may get name collisions if the HOC's prop is the same as another prop.

Example will build a simple (insecure) `withAuth()` HOC that uses context to store shared data.

`withAuth()` will provide two props to wrapped components

-  logged in user's name; `''` means user isn't logged in
-  setter function for name
-  `AuthContext` will store the data
   -  `useState()` to get the state parts, accept a default name, wrap `children`
   -  Default name simulates cookie-based "remember me"
-  In `SpeakerApp`, wrap the returned component in `AuthContextProvider`
-  In `withAuth()`
   -  Get the context data from `AuthContext`
   -  Pass as props to the wrapped component

To use `AuthContext`

-  Add login/logout to `Header`
   -  Based on `loggedInUserName`, show name and logout button or show login button
   -  On logout, set name to `''`
   -  On login, prompt for name and set name
   -  `export default withAuth(Header)`
-  In `SpeakerAdd` only allow if user is logged in
   -  If `loggedInUserName` is empty, don't allow add
-  Because `Header` and `SpeakerAdd` are returning `withAuth(...)`, change imports where used to `import NAME` instead of `import { NAME }`

Testing it, this is working.

I'm not sure how often I'd do something like this in practical use, but I can see how component libraries would use this. Knowing what's going on is useful for understanding the bigger picture. If I needed to do this, I'd probably want a bit more exposure to the concept to be sure I got it right. Maybe that will come later in the course.

## Course summary

-  How components communicate is critical to building applications
-  Custom hooks allows standardizing/commoninizing state patterns
-  Context is a good way to share data between components without prop drilling
-  `ErrorBoundary` lets us provide sane error behavior at run time
-  Higher order components and render props are ways to wrap components in other components, which is common in libraries we might use

**COMMIT: 6.0.3 - FEAT: Add login/logout capability; limit add function to logged in users**
