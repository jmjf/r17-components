# Designing better React components

## Introduction

-  Component - independent, reusable building blocks of a UI
   -  React class components extend `React.Component` and implement a `render` function that returns JSX
   -  React function components return JSX <- style to use (seems to be dominant focus for React in general)
-  All course code on GitHub `pkellner/pluralsight-designing-react-components-course-code`
-  Demo app is a conference speakers/sessions app

## Development environment

-  VS Code
-  Next.js
-  `npm i react react-dom next`
-  Add scripts for Next.js (dev, build, start)
-  Next.js uses file based routing. Any `.js` in `pages` maps to `localhost/<filename-minus-js>`; `index.js` is `localhost` root
-  Create a simple "Hello world" component in `pages/index.js` to confirm the parts are there
-  `npm run dev` to see it work

When he gets to setting up a the real application,, I'll look at the Next.js TypeScript info and set up a TS application.
Ref: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript
Looks like:

-  `npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node`
   OR
-  `npx create-next-app@latest --ts`

and then just use TS where appropriate.

## Concepts and decisions

-  React applications are sets of components that use properties and state to render the application; changing state changes what's rendered
-  Starting point for an application is thinking about how to break it down into components. (I say it's like how a graphic designer/typographer might look at a page.)
   -  What are the major parts of the UI?
   -  What are the repeating parts of those parts that can be generalized and reused?
   -  What is the right level of decomposition/composition?
-  Common chunks of a UI include:
   -  Header (title, logo, etc.)
   -  Navigation or primary controls
   -  Main content area
   -  Footer
   -  Each of these may be broken into smaller parts
-  In the demo app
   -  The main content area has a set of speaker/session cards -- build a Card component and reuse it (DRY)
   -  The header has a sign-in/out button with a user name -- seems like a candidate (single responsibility -- header doesn't need that logic)
   -  Sometimes pieces should be combined (header logo + title) -- manage complexity (making them separate doesn't get real benefits)
-  Speaker cards have an image, name, favorite tag, biography, company, Twitter link, and a list of session titles and locations

   -  Recognize similar components (icons with associated text) and think in terms of inheritance

-  Get assets and starting pages from GitHub repo. I'll TS-ify them.
   -  He's using `_document.js` as the page template. I'm guessing that's a Next.js thing.

**COMMIT 1.0.1 - CHORE: build a simple dev environment and test it with Hello World**

### Setting up my working space

-  Install TS bits - `npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node`
   -  NOTE: Did this before commit 1.0.1 (oops)
-  Get his GH repo into a local directory and move it into my work space
-  Install ESlint - `npm install eslint eslint-config-next` and add `lint` script and `npm run lint` to set up `.eslintrc.json`
-  Enable Prettier on TS-react -> Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P), Preferences: Open Settings (JSON), add below [from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61731587/prettier-doesnt-format-tsx-file)

```JSON
"[typescriptreact]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
},
```

-  Change .js files to .ts/.tsx files and add types where appropriate.
-  Update `tsconfig.json` based on what `create-next-app --ts` creates (I created in another directory and copied)
   -  Keeping it around in case I need to refer to it later (minus `node_modules`).
   -  Also `next.config.js`

And it's compiling and rendering, so we have the basic environment I want to use for the course together.

**COMMIT: 1.0.2: CHORE: build baseline setup I want to use**
