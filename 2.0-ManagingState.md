# Managing state

## Intro

-  Key part of React applications is
   -  Passing data between components
   -  Designing and managing those interfaces well

Next step is a header and toolbar that supports searching and controlling parts of the UI.

-  Header (logo, title, username, sign in/out)
-  Toolbar (year filter, show sessions option, theme option, search)
-  Speakers (collection of SpeakerCard components)

## Setting up components

-  Move the `speakers-list` `<div>` out of `src/index.tsx` into `SpeakersList.tsx` and built a component
-  Create `Speakers` component to get data and render `SpeakersList`
   -  Move `data` import over too.
-  `src/index.tsx` renders `Speakers` component

**COMMIT: 2.0.1 - REFACTOR: move speaker list into separate components**

-  Create a `Header` component
-  Render it in `src/index.tsx`
