# Managing state

## Intro

-  Key part of React applications is
   -  Passing data between components
   -  Designing and managing those interfaces well

Next step is a header and toolbar that supports searching and controlling parts of the UI.

-  Header (logo, title, username, sign in/out)
-  Toolbar (year filter, show sessions option, theme option, search)
-  Speakers (collection of SpeakerCard components)

## Setting up components

-  Move the `speakers-list` `<div>` out of `src/index.tsx` into `SpeakersList.tsx` and built a component
-  Create `Speakers` component to get data and render `SpeakersList`
   -  Move `data` import over too.
-  `src/index.tsx` renders `Speakers` component

**COMMIT: 2.0.1 - REFACTOR: move speaker list into separate components**

-  Create a `Header` component (name and sign in/out are stubs for now)
-  Render it in `src/index.tsx`
-  Create a `SpeakersToolbar` component (show sessions switch, theme dropdown)
-  Render it in `src/index.tsx`

Controls aren't active because they have no event handlers

**COMMIT: 2.0.2 - FEAT: add header and toolbar**

## Giving the toolbar local state

-  `props` are passed to a component and component can't change
-  state is declared inside a component and component can change
   -  can be passed to children and affect what they display or how they behave

So, I think we're going to

-  `useState()` to create a couple of state values on the toolbar
-  bind those state variables to the controls in place of hard coded values (true and "light")

And the compiler/Next tells me I'll need handlers of some kind, so let's see what he does. Which means calling the setters.

-  For checkbox, set to `ev.target.checked` (though I suspect I could use `!showSessionsFlag` too)
-  For select, set to `ev.target.value`

Now the controls change, but changing them doesn't do anything.

(I'm not liking how much stuff is in the toolbar, but I'm guessing he's going to break it down more at some point.)

**COMMIT: 2.0.3 - FEAT: make toolbar controls accept input**

## Sharing state between components

State can only pass from parent to child.

For the toolbar controls we have, we need to get the state out so the whole application can see it. Theme affects everything; show sessions affects `SpeakerCard`. (Hmm. No `App`, so maybe it goes on `index.tsx`?)

Oh, I see. He put all the UI controls in `Speakers`, not `index.tsx`. So, moved that and it works. Now let's get to state, which moves to `Speakers`, and pass everything to `SpeakersToolbar`. Add the theme to the containing `<div>` in `Speakers`.

-  He user a ternary which was kind of ugly, so I turned it into a template string.

That's working so far, mostly:

-  `Header` text needs to render a sane color based on theme (so pass `themeName` and style)

Not fixed yet

-  `SpeakersToolbar` background isn't changing
-  `SpeakerCard` background and text needs to change and render sanely
-  Show Sessions toggle doesn't do anything

**COMMIT: 2.0.4 - FEAT: make toolbar control change theme by lifting state to Speakers**

Issue: In a larger application, state in the parent may be far from where it's used. We end up passing state through many layers of components to get it to the right place. For example, `showSessionsFlag` needs to get to the `Sessions` section of the `SpeakerCard` in `SpeakersList`. The interface becomes cumbersome.

-  Rename `Speakers` to `App`
   -  I know there's already an `App` in the component hierarchy (from Next), so will this conflict?
   -  Even if it doesn't maybe I should name this something else to make it easier to understand
   -  Let's go with `SpeakersApp` for now -- rename, adjust `index.tsx`
-  Now put `SpeakersToolbar` and `SpeakersList` in a new `Speakers` component.
   -  Is this really going to help? I still need state in `Header`, don't I?
   -  Ah, he leaves theme state in the top level and moves `showSessionsFlag` state to the new component
   -  Ah 2, he didn't move `showSessionFlag` earlier
   -  This feels kind of clunky. Maybe he's going to cover a better solution in a future module.
-  Pass `showSessionsFlag` down the hierarchy to the point it's acutally used (prop drilling)
   -  He says this isn't good, which is what I was thinking, and promising better solutions in a future module
   -  Conditionally render `Sessions` based on `showSessionsFlag`

The toggle works now. I notice that Firefox isn't rendering it quite right. The gray session info component hangs outside the containing border. Testing suggests `w-100` really needs to be more like 97.25%. Chromium has the same issue, so maybe this is a font thing. Looking at the details, it's using `sans-serif`. It looks like the Google Fonts URL is pulling Open Sans but the `body` style uses (among other things) Noto Sans. Let's change it and see what happens. That didn't work. Oh, class name is wrong on the `sessionBox` `<div>`. That fixed the layout issue. I can't get Noto Sans to work even using Google-recommended URLs. Roboto works, though, so I'll use it instead.

**COMMIT: 2.0.5 - REFACTOR: reorganize component hierarchy to move showSessionsFlag state closer to where it's used (sort of)**
