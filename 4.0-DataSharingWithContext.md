# Sharing data with context and `useContext()`

Shares data between a component and its descendants without passing props. It's like global data but scoped from the component where it's declared and lower. Toolbar controls in the example app are good cases for context.

## Use context to share theme info

In `SpeakersApp`, we create state for the theme and pass to `Speakers` and `Header`, plus use in `SpeakersApp`.

-  Create context instance with `createContext()` and export it so other components can import it to use.
-  Wrap parent component for context `<[context-name].Provider>`
-  Add data to the context by passing in `value` attribute
-  For TypeScript

   -  Declare an interface that represents data we'll put in the context
   -  `export const ExampleContext = createContext<IExampleContext>({} as IThemeContext);`
      -  Setting like this instead of `createContext<IExampleContext | null>(null);` avoids needing to cast as `IThemeContext` everywhere
   -  Then wrap JSX with something like`<ExampleContext.Provider value={{example, setExample}}>`

-  In `Header`, import the context and interface
-  `const { themeName } = useContext(ThemeContext);`
   -  When I tried `<IExampleContext | null>` version, I had to cast as `IThemeContext` here to avoid complaints that the context could be null.
-  A quick test shows the header works as expected; on to the toolbar
-  `useContext()` as above and destructure both `themeName` and `setThemeName`
-  Remove theme props from all declarations and uses in `Header`, `Speakers`, `SpeakersToolbar`, and `SpeakersApp`

Everything looks like it's working.

**COMMIT: 4.0.1 - REFACTOR: replace props for theme state sharing with context**
