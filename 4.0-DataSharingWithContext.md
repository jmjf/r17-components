# Sharing data with context and `useContext()`

Shares data between a component and its descendants without passing props. It's like global data but scoped from the component where it's declared and lower. Toolbar controls in the example app are good cases for context.

## Use context to share theme info

In `SpeakersApp`, we create state for the theme and pass to `Speakers` and `Header`, plus use in `SpeakersApp`.

-  Create context instance with `createContext()` and export it so other components can import it to use.
-  Wrap parent component for context `<[context-name].Provider>`
-  Add data to the context by passing in `value` attribute
-  For TypeScript

   -  Declare an interface that represents data we'll put in the context
   -  `export const ExampleContext = createContext<IExampleContext>({} as IThemeContext);`
      -  Setting like this instead of `createContext<IExampleContext | null>(null);` avoids needing to cast as `IThemeContext` everywhere
   -  Then wrap JSX with something like`<ExampleContext.Provider value={{example, setExample}}>`

-  In `Header`, import the context and interface
-  `const { themeName } = useContext(ThemeContext);`
   -  When I tried `<IExampleContext | null>` version, I had to cast as `IThemeContext` here to avoid complaints that the context could be null.
-  A quick test shows the header works as expected; on to the toolbar
-  `useContext()` as above and destructure both `themeName` and `setThemeName`
-  Remove theme props from all declarations and uses in `Header`, `Speakers`, `SpeakersToolbar`, and `SpeakersApp`

Everything looks like it's working.

**COMMIT: 4.0.1 - REFACTOR: replace props for theme state sharing with context**

## Use a layout component for theme control

`SpeakersApp` has state/context management in addition to appearance. Let's move as much theme related stuff as we can to a new component.

-  Create a `Layout` component that handles theme context and state.
   -  Takes a prop `children`, which has type `JSX.Element`
      -  Standard/default prop that represents whatever is wrapped in `<Layout>`
   -  Also takes `startingTheme` and uses it to initialize state
   -  JSX wraps `{children}` in the theming `<div>`, which is wrapped in the `<ThemeContext.Provider>`
      -  Gives everything under `Layout` ability to use `ThemeContext`
   -  Declared `type ThemeType = 'light' | 'dark';` and used to encourage the value to be the right thing
      -  If I add another theme option in the dropdown, I need to add it to the type and logic that selects theme styles
-  In `SpeakersApp`
   -  Remove state and context
   -  Replace `ThemeContext` and theming `<div>` with `<Layout>` as a wrapper; `startingTheme="light"`
-  Everything that imports `ThemeContext` needs to get it from `Layout` now
   -  Affects `Headers` and `SpeakersToolbar`
   -  `SpeakersToolbar` uses `setThemeName`, so it needed to import `ThemeType` so it could cast to it

Now, theming is managed in `Layout` and `SpeakerApp`'s only connection to the theme is setting the initial theme.

-  Could hard code it in `Layout`, but I think this sets us up better to support the idea of a user profile with a preferred theme or detecting browser settings that might specify a preference.

In more complex applications, `Layout` may contain the header, footer, sidebars, and other base page structural components. If we had more than one page, it might make sense.

**COMMIT: 4.0.2 - REFACTOR: replace theming in SpeakersApp with a Layout component to simplify SpeakersApp (single responsibility)**

### Move `ThemeContext` out of `Layout`

Keeping contexts separate from components reduces path name changes when we refactor components.

So, I'm guessing he'll

-  Create a context directory
-  Move the context defintion from `Layout` to a new file
-  Import the context in `Layout` so he can use `ThemeContext.Provider`
-  Change paths for everything affected

-  He says he's going to export `ThemeProvider` instead

-  Copy `Layout` to `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`
   -  Remove the `<div>` that sets the theme on `{children}`; keep `{children}`
   -  Rename `ILayoutProps` to `IThemeContextProps`
-  In `Layout`
   -  Keep `interface ILayoutProps`, but remove other declarations before `Layout`
   -  Remove state
   -  Get `themeName` from `useContext` destructure
   -  Replace `ThemeContext.Provider` with `ThemeContextProvider`
   -  Pass `startingTheme` to `ThemeContextProvider`

But there's a problem. We're trying to use `ThemeContext` in `Layout`, so we need to rename `Layout` and create a new `Layout` that wraps the renamed `Layout`.

-  Sounds convoluted, but the code is simple and, when you think about what it's doing, makes sense
-  I declared an interface for the renamed `Layout`, but then looked and found a React type `PropsWithChildren` that worked
-  So I changed `ILayoutProps` to extend `PropsWithChildren` instead of declaring `children: JSX.Element` on it

-  Update imports in `Header` and `SpeakersToolbar` (won't happen again now that context is outside any component that might get refactored)

The app seems to be working as expected still.

**COMMIT: 4.0.3 - REFACTOR: move ThemeContext and related bits out of components that might change to reduce future import changes affecting context**

### Use a custom hook for ThemeContext state

All this refactoring is about separating concerns such as page render, state, context, data access, etc. In this app, `ThemeContext` only has one state value and its setter. In more complex applications, contexts may have many state values, state validation, etc. Separate context state into a custom hook. Overkill for the example, but we'll practice with `ThemeContext`.

I think this is fairly simple. Just move the state out of `ThemeContext` to `src/hooks/useTheme.tsx` and return the state and setter. Then `useTheme()` in `ThemeContext` to get the state.

-  React `Dispatch<SetStateAction<S>>` is the proper type for a state setter function
-  I could even `useTheme()` in the JSX in `ThemeContext` instead of destructuring and restructuring the return

He extends `useTheme` to validate the theme by writing a validator function and returning that instead of `setThemeName`. I think that will affect my interface. (It does, but I got the types sorted out.)

This is low value right now, but more state in the context is coming.

**COMMIT: 4.0.4 - REFACTOR: move state from ThemeContext to useTheme to separate concerns and prepare for more state in ThemeContext**

## Add a filter option to the toolbar and context

We have four controls on the toolbar. We could have a context for each control, but it's probably better to have a single context that manages all the toolbar settings.

-  He's saying create a new context and custom hook, and maybe he'll eventually merge `ThemeContext` into it.
-  He's also calling it `SpeakerFilterContext`, but only one of the options is a filter, the others would be the theme, show sessions, and search. That doesn't sound like a speaker filter to me. My sense is, `ToolbarContext` might be a better name, though I'm not sure that's much better. I'll think about it as I work through this. For now, I'll go with his name.
-  First move will be to get show speakers in the new context.

So, I think that means

-  Set up a new context
-  Define the custom hook to set up its state
-  Bind the show sessions toggle to it, which will probably happen by including the context in `SpeakersApp`.
   -  Which makes me wonder how this will play with the existing `ThemeProvider` wrapper. I can see that getting ugly, but maybe we'll move theme there.
   -  Or maybe we say the remaining items only apply to `Speakers`, which includes the toolbar and list.

What's the state for our new context? -- `showSessions` and `setShowSessions`

-  Define custom hook `useSpeakerControls` (I chose a name)
   -  The context will have all the controls related to the speakers shown, so `SpeakerControlsContext` and related names
   -  It only applies to `Speakers`, so won't merge with `ThemeContext`
   -  I don't think I need a validator for `showSessions` because it's a boolean (so the setter is type `Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>`)
-  Define the context to use the custom hook
   -  Similar to `ThemeContext`
   -  One thing that bothers me is that I have the same interface declared twice with different names. I'll alias the state interface it in the context.
   -  In fact, let's not even alias it. I'm creating `XContext<XState>`, so using the state type makes sense.
-  Wrap `Speakers` in the context

The toggle isn't starting in the expected initial state and I get an error (`setShowSessionsFlag is not a function`) from the toolbar when I click it.

-  Why isn't the toggle starting true? -- Ah, context doesn't exist. I need the "no context" wrapper.
-  That fixed it after a couple of tries to get it right (main goof was forgetting to wrap the "no context" in the context provider)

Now, let's see how he does this.

-  He didn't assign a default for the custom hook's `startingShowSessionsFlag` argument
-  He defaults it in the context, which is the opposite of the theme state and context, so I'm leaving mine as is
-  He also doesn't do the "no context" wrapper, instead removes props from `SpeakersToolbar` and `SpeakersList` and then gets the context in the components that need it
   -  Key point about context that I need to remember -- use it where it's needed, don't pass it around like props

So, let's do that.

-  Remove `showSessionsFlag` related props from `SpeakersToolbar`, `SpeakersList`, and other components
-  Use context where `showSessionsFlag` related data is needed (`SpeakersToolbar`, `SpeakerCard`)
-  `Speakers` wraps the two components in the provider
-  Remove code, imports, interfaces, etc., I don't need anymore

Now `Speakers` is about UI layout (component tree), `SpeakerControlsState` manages data, `SpeakerControlsContext` shares the state, and we're passing fewer props.

While I was working on this, I adjusted the loading message to show a spinning `fa-sync` icon scaled up a bit.

**COMMIT: 4.0.5 - REFACTOR: move show sessions state to SpeakerControlsContext and useSpeakerControls**

## Good practices notes

-  Separate standard page structure from the main App component equivalent so it's easier to reason about and manage
-  Keep contexts in a separate directory so import references are less likely to change
-  Separate concerns including page layout, state, context, and data access so code is more reusable and easier to reason about
-  When creating new contexts, start by defining the state (and custom hook)
